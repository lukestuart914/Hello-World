# Hello-World
Just trying to figure out what I'm doing
Yeah there some confusing stuff in the guide.
For example, on this step, It says click the README.md file, Is that supposed to be the readme edits? because if I just click the readme.md and the pencil then it tries to edit the main branch and the message at the bottom is "commit directly to the MAIN branch.  
Oh nevermind I found the drop down menu for go to file and clicked README.md then clicked the pencil and it had the commit to readme-edits branch
